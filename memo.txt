Things to be considered

Board members page, so much white on cards and on page
    - Background image? Squeezing?
    - member images?

Consistently boring font types
    - Bold caps headers everywhere?

Order of footer, first header, then addresses, then some links?

Footer icons, more round shape for some icons?

Button/link coloring to red/black?

Mysterious gap top margin on favicons when screen width enough

Navbar futile first link?

Link page gallery link

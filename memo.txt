Things to be considered

Board members page, so much white on cards and on page
    - Background image? Squeezing?
    - member images?

Consistently boring font types
    - Bold caps headers everywhere?

Order of footer, first header, then addresses, then some links?

Footer icons, more round shape for some icons?

Mysterious gap top margin on favicons when screen width enough

Navbar futile first link?

Link page gallery link

Blue buttons dont fit to this theme very well, gray buttons? Red? Black?

Galleria linkki

Rethinking names on board members etc?

Set form token and stuff to make it working and test

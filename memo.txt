Things to be considered

Consistently boring font types
    - Bold caps headers everywhere?

Order of footer, first header, then addresses, then some links?

Footer icons, more round shape for some icons?

Mysterious gap top margin on favicons when screen width enough

Navbar futile first link?

Link page gallery link

Blue buttons dont fit to this theme very well, gray buttons? Red? Black?

Galleria linkki
    - old gallery still to be made?
Set form token and stuff to make it working and test

Rethink old board member naming order etc
